**Example description:**  
Server `server.py` share its webcam video to each connected `client.py`.  
This version does not support slow network.  
For slow network see `TCP/socket_buffer` and `TCP/slow_network` example.

This example is inspired from here:   
Socket programming to send and receive webcam video | PyShine
https://pyshine.com/Socket-programming-and-openc/

I invented after another two more light methods to send data: 
- [x] `TCP/slow_network` 
- [x] `TCP/socket_buffer`.
